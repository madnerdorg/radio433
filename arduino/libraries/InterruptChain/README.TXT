InterruptChain library v1.4.0 (20140128) for Arduino 1.0
Made by Randy Simons http://randysimons.nl/

This library allows for daisychaining the interrupts, i.e. you can attach
more than one interrupt handler to a single interrupt.

See the examples for usage. See InterruptChainLib.h for details!

Installation of library:
 - Make sure Arduino is closed
 - Copy the directory InterruptChain to the Arduino library directory (usually
   <Sketchbook directory>/libraries/)
   See http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries for detailed instructions.

Examples are provided.


Changelog:
InterruptChain library v1.4.0 (20140128) for Arduino 1.0
 - Fixed bug where mode for interrupts > 0 was LOW instead of the default
   CHANGE. However, the default now is LOW. This breaks compatibility. Use
   setMode to set the interrupt mode to CHANGE, if needed.

InterruptChain library v1.3.0 (20130601) for Arduino 1.0
 - Dropped support for Arduino pre-1.0
 - Doesn't use recursion internally, and fewer function calls. This should save
   some extra bytes in RAM, at the cost of moderately increased Flash usage.

InterruptChain library v1.2.0 (20120213) for Arduino 0022/1.0
 - Support for Arduino 1.0.

InterruptChain library v1.1.0 (20110921) for Arduino 0022
 - Added enable, disable. Expanded setMode.

InterruptChain library v1.0.0 (20110919) for Arduino 0022
 - First release
